# Agenda for the 2015/06/24 Board meeting of the Fort Collins Creator Hub

## Approval of 2015/06/10 minutes

## Treasurer's report

> AI: SteveU: Send email to Jeff Moe to thank him for his donation.

## Publicity/outreach report

> AI: Farra: Generate a report on progress at the next meeting.

We're nearly at the end of our tax year. We need to get organized to fill in
and file our tax forms. Hopefully our 501c3 application will be approved
before we need to file, but we need to be ready either way, and find out
exactly what to do if we're not yet approved.

## Education committee report

## Equipment purchases/donations

### 3D printer donations

> AI: SteveU: Speak to Jamie about borrowing something from LCS in the mean
> time.

> AI: Hugh Wallace: Plan layout for printer station/shelving/...

### Laser cutter/engraver

> AI: Hugh: Follow up on quotes.

## Tier4 proposal

> AI: Lou: Talk to Mark to get details of prior discussions. Write a draft
> proposal and send it to the board for comments before the next meeting.

> AI: Anyone interested (ESPECIALLY ALL of the board): Come up with a list of
> around 5-6 points that are the most important things you'd like to see in any
> such agreement, and send them to the board <board@fortcollinscreatorhub.org>,
> Mark Roberts <mark@harbortronics.com>, and Lou <lhsharpe@gmail.com> for
> distillation.

## Denver Mini Maker Faire report

> AI: StephenW: Get more business cards made to give out at the Faire.

It was too cost prohibitive to order more cards in time for the faire. I have
ordered 2500 more for the future.

## Any other business
