Today's meeting centered on recent reports of miss-use of the facilities at the Hub. Over the past two weeks there were very 
distressing reports that some Hub members were allowing non-members, possibly homeless persons, to occupy the space overnight.  
In addition, one particular person who calls himself Broox Authement has been banned from the Hub for disorderly behavior.

Because our present location is vulnerable to unauthorized behavior, the board collectively  updated a new set of rules to 
follow:

The Front Door
If the front door is open, anyone can walk in. While the door is typically open for classroom time and other 
events open to the public, members who are there for projects should make sure the door is locked except during  the regular 
hours (9-5)

- No propping of the door
- No leaving unlocked (except during business hours
Possible addition â€“ adding a doorbell

Refrigerator:
Some may have abused the facilities up-stairs. Members are no longer allowed to use the refrigerator.
 
Guests are allowed only if:
- They are helping with a project
- They are taking a tour
- They are taking a class
- They are attending a Hub sponsored event
 Members must accompany guests in the shop 
 

Noise:
 Keep noise down during business hours ( 8-5)
 Warn tenants up-stars if you know you might have to be loud (make it short)


Sign-In Sheet
- Everyone signs in and out, even guests

Possible other changes:
 Limit hours for members and guests
 Limit number of guests except for special Hub events
 Install Web Cam
 Hire Security

 Further discussions will follow, especially if more complaints come from the businesses upstairs. In the meantime board 
 members will visit the location at odd hours to check on the space for possible violations.
