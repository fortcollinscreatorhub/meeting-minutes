Treasurer's Report
We have about $11,000 in the bank. Operating costs are approximately $990 per month. Current income from membership 
dues is around $600 per month as less than 60% of membership are actually paying members. It was noted that this 
could be a problem in the future and should be addressed fairly soon.

President's Address
As there were no agenda for this meeting, our president suggested some areas to consider for the near future:

1) We need to keep up the momentum on maker education classes from the last mini maker faire. Having at least two 
classes per week would be the ideal setting. We need to query our Meet-up membership for possible instructors and 
class ideas. Note: Instructors do not have to be members of the FCCH.

2) We need a better marketing plan for our organization. We are aware that marketing is not the board's strongest 
suit but we are willing to try new ways to 'get the word out'.

3) We need to start searching for a larger maker space. Our current situation does not allow us to expand. The 
ideal situation would be a place located in town with street level access, a garage door and low rent.

Action Items:

Curt – Look for possible locations for rent and come up with a list of possible locations.

Steve – Look into setting up new classes at the FCCH.

Lou – Take a stab at marketing.

Jim – Help out with the above.

Eric – Continue evaluating shared space.
