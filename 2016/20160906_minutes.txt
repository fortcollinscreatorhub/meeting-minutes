Guests:

Note: This was an updated board meeting from past month's meetings that went unscripted due to the secretary's absence while on that crazy bike ride across Iowa. Also, while president Undy was in DC, the earlier meeting was postponed until Tuesday, September 6th.

Some events from past meetings: The current set date and time for board meetings have been changed due to employment issues of some of the members. As of this time, a regular board meeting has not been established.

Requested agenda items from last month included proposed changes to our bylaws. 
A copy of the bylaws can be found  here:

Curt Oliver has made the following changes as follows:

Article 3, section 1: five elected Members changed to three to seven elected Persons.

Article 3, section 3 on Eligibility: Member changed to Person and 4-#4 amended to read “Be willing and able to serve on the board and advance the Purpose of the Fort Collins Creator Hub.

Article 3, section 4: Change Board of Direction to Board in title, add “or as agreed upon unanimously by the current serving Board” to eliminate the designated election month of October.

Article 3, section 4.2 on Elections to Fill Vacancies, the board may hold an election to fill the vacancy. If no person is nominated by the date of an election, the position will be considered newly vacant.

Article 3 Section 4.2 on nomination process, Members are changed to Persons; The requirement to have a quorum of 25% of members was eliminated (section 4.4.1)

The above changes now allow non-members to become board members and the maximum number of board members has increased from 5 to 7.

Now, on to the agenda

1) Develop a model of how much time we have left under various scenarios:
    Per Erik, amount on hand: $9770 w/ $600 form membership per month. Zach supplied data on worst case gas/electric bills during the winter. The official “ballpark” analysis at this moment was “20 months”. It was suggested that we take an average cost per month and add it to our rent payment. Zach agreed to this.

2) Financial Plan:
Steve Undy is getting help from the Loveland Creator Space on getting a business plan together.

3) Corporate Sponsorship:
We decided to have several levels of corporate sponsorship, the lowest level being a corporate logo on our website. Curt will work on some proposals for corporate membership concepts. Lou will check out how Innosphere and Galvanize can help us with the concept.

4) Discuss and vote on City/Bas Bleu funding and associated work:
   Zach proposed an idea to reorganize the floor plan to help facilitate the “Young Maker's Camp” wherein the Bas Bleu can utilize the city grant money through the end of the year by essentially paying rent to the Creator Hub to help pay for fitting the current space for educational purposes. The board voted unanimously in favor of this plan. If the plan is put into place, it would help renew our vision of our new building site and it would certainly help to increase membership.

5) Bohemian and Otter Cares grants:
Per Steve, we will propose a $16K grant via help from the Colorado Maker Hub to help train teachers in the maker tradition. 

6) Discuss creating a solid and repeating class schedule:
Steve will get some ideas from the RXTX makerspace, but it was suggested that we have  classes on the “BASICS” in each area, i.e., Technology, Woodworking, Metalworking, etc. that could be held monthly or weekly. These classes would be mandatory for anyone to be permitted to work in these areas and would include safety training and some degree of shop etiquette.


7) How to attract new members and keep them:
It was imagined that if we were successful in implementing points 4 and 6 from the above we could easily retain new and exciting members. The idea of a class called “Wine, Women, and Welding” was suggested as a special class to get women involved with the maker community by building a wine rack.

Last minute items:
Curt will propose a new member ship cost (a slightly higher single month fee) and to purge the membership database of non-paying members.

The next meeting is TBD until Erik finds out his work schedule. Zach would like to attend meetings; His choice of nights would be Tuesday or Thursday.
