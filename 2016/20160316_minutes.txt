Not present:

As there was not any agenda for today, the board meeting was fairly short:

Maker space search:
Per anything about the Carnegie Building usage, it looks like that will be shelved for the moment unless we have an enormous interest from the art community. We could look into various empty spaces owned by the city i.e., the utilities offices at 117N. Mason; perhaps we should be aware of what the city's  “Budgeting for Outcomes”  office is currently doing.

On Growing the Organization:
We need new tools. We need some kind of mill and a better CNC. Some members suggested building our own 3D printer and laser cutter.

Lockers: Currently we are checking Craig's list for lockers; Is $250 too much? Also, Lou mentioned plastic storage bins called “Action Packers” that might be a good alternative while we are still living in a basement.
