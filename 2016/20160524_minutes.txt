Note: An “emergency” board meeting was held on May 12, 2016 at YendraBuilt, 1304 Duff Drive, Fort Collins with all board members present.  At our last board meeting, we learned that some local makers were organizing a maker camp in partnership with the Bas Bleu Theater and Zach Yendra, the owner of Yendrabuilt, a custom furniture design company.
The board also learned that Zach Yendra was intending to re-locate his company to another town and offered to rent out part of his unit along with providing assistance to the maker community. By a  preliminary vote of 4 to 1, the board decided to agree to Zach's proposal .


Agenda items:
 
Board discussion / vote on new space, Insurance / internet call, Mayor visit, Community Funded, Joe from the TXRX makerspace, Posters, New West Fest, Grand opening.

On the new space at Yendrabuilt: 
At this point it was noted that we have not signed the lease to the Yendrabuilt space, so the board voted 4 to 0 to officially proceed with the new space. According to Zach he is only charging half a month's rent for June while we plan to move in. We will need a firm commitment from Zach, but we are expected to get things started as soon as possible. Curt volunteered to coordinate the cleanup and move-in. We should budget for some cleaning materials, paint, ladders and U-Haul rental. A tentative date for cleaning was set for June 18 and 19 with the actual move to be started around June 24 to be completed by June 26.
Jim will check the CSU surplus for desks and chairs now that the semester is over and will coorinate with Erik to have them moved to the new location.
Some initial walls would be construced by July 9th; Any of this cleaning/painting/building will hopefully be accomplished with volunteer labor. The initial wall estimated cost is $1600.  Volunteers will be rewarded with pizza and beer/soft drinks for their hard work.

Insurance/Internet:
We imagine that our insurance premiums for the larger space will increase; Erik will call the insurance company for an adjustment. Curt will find out if we can transfer our current internet provider to the new space.

Mayor visit:
We scheduled a visit from Wade Troxell, the Mayor of Fort Collins on July 26; He will be accompanied by  City Manager Darin Atteberry and Economic Health Director Josh Birks.

Community Funded:
Jim and Erik met with Mccabe Calahan from Community Funded to discuss ways to address the maker community for financial help. Even though the Community Funded operation generally is a funding software company (typically starting at $10K per organization to start) we felt that the meeting was helpful. For instance, it was not out too unusual in Mccabe's mind to expect donations or $20 from each of our meet-up members, although that concept has not been tested (yet!). Perhaps we could urge our members with a matching grant from the city? We have to get an application in by June 15. Jim volunteered to have a crack at it.

Texas Makerspace:
Joe from the makerspace in Texas wants to discuss some education options with us the next time he is in town. Steve Undy was originally going to do this, but since he will be out of town most of the month of June, Jim volunteered to do this.

Posters:
Both Jim and Steve had the same idea of a poster that emulated Soviet era propaganda, i.e., workers unite! And that sort of thing. Steve also mentioned that he had someone in mind who might lend us some art-work.

New West Fest:
The board decided that having a booth at New West Fest would be a great idea to get the word out about our space. The dates of the NWF are August 12,13,14. It should cost us about $450 for a booth with electrical hook-ups.

Grand Opening:
We will have some sort of party after the New West Fest end of August. 


Next Meeting:
Our next regular meeting will be at 7:00 pm on Tuesday, June 28, 2016, location TBA.
