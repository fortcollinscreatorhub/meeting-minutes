Agenda items:
New Tables and chairs RE: Chair graveyard
The board decided to buy some replacement chairs and tables: It seems that the folding tables we presently have are not very sturdy and a number of chairs we have are broken. The board decided to spend not more that $400 to replace some tables and chairs. Erik will look at what is available at CSU surplus and Jim will check out a tip from Brad about some custom tables stored in the basement of Walnut Creek.


Tool Wish List
Generally the tool list will act as a guide for when certain tools are available at a good price. If a particular tool that we need becomes available the board members can individually use their own judgment to make a decision to purchase the tool.


Board Meeting time/day change
The Board may move our regular meeting to the third Tuesday of the month. The time was not discussed but it will probably be at 7:00. 

Makerspace Conference - July 16 and 17
This meeting is at the Tinkermill in Longmont and it was decided that we should be represented there. Steve U. and Erik A. may be able to attend.

New West Fest Booth - Aug 12-14
We should have a table there but it costs money. Perhaps we can find a sponsor and volunteers to man the booth?

Milling machines: The board will vote via email on the decision to purchase a small milling machine similar to a Nomad 883 costing in the $2K range.

Involvement with Poudre School District:
The HUB now has some contacts with the school district and will make arrangement in the future for various  outreach possibilities thanks to Steve Undy. The members are encouraged to participate in the up-coming Ed-Tech meetup on May 10th.


Table at OTHA's STEAM2 Design Faire - June 24
Jim Z. will be organizing a table for the HUB at this event.

Community night at Pour Brother's Tavern
This is a local pub that is soliciting donations for non-profit groups. JimZ will schedule a day to do this, just not the month of June.


Denver Mini-Maker Faire June 11-12
Steve U. is out of the country in June but will check with Jaimie at the Loveland space to see if we can share a table in Denver.

Selling Arudino starter kits (new idea):
Steve U. found another source for inexpensive arduino boards; We could possible sell these as part of electronic kits for anyone interested in learning electronics.

Gathering class attendance information:
Steve U. will make some attendance sheets for any classes we will have in the future; This should improve are record keeping efforts as well as have vital information for grant proposal requests.

Next Meeting:
If the board is in agreement, our next meeting will be at 7:00 pm on Tuesday, May 17th, 2016
