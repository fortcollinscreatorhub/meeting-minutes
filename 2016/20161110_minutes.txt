2) Space update
Finally the palette racks were delivered. Steve hopes the board members have time to unload the rented trailer so he can return it in the morning. (we did!) Some assembly is required, so a work crew will begin this weekend. We will need a welding table which we should be able to build with Zach's help.

3) Encore Fellowship

Retired folks from Intel (this would be Steve) has applies for Intel's Encore Fellowship grant that would provide a paid half time (1000 hours) employee for the hub for general maker space activities on a regular basis. This would mean we would have someone at the hub that could welcome visitors, sign-up new members, manage our website and collect names for mailings, etc. 


Steven retirement from Intel , offers the encore fellowship, Intel give $3500 for 1000 houres of time, we have someone to fill this one. "Serif Fernando" is this person, could keep an eye on the place to greet people, get them signed up, resource for members. Manage website, collect names for mailings, etc.  Other open times can he taken by board members on a volunteer basis.
We also thought it would be good to have a physical phone for people to call the hub. Curt will look into this.

Lou memtioned some management software:
toggle - time mgmnt
insightly - CRM platform (inquiries tracking)
zendesk - support system, reminders on follow-ups
RightSignature - electronic signature
Xero - financial manager
Basecamp - project management tool

4) Nation of Makers Support letter
The board agreed to send out a letter of support the Nation of Makers. Elese VanDynewill be our local contact.


5) volunteering for membership

The board discussed possible internships (from CSU?) Maybe a work an hour, play an hour membership. It would have to be managed-- maybe by our Encore worker?

6) corporate sponsorship/ membership levels
We need to come up with some entry level of corporate membership-- This discussion was tabled for a later date.

Other items:


Rebeca volunteered to help with grant proposals.

Could we put up solar panel to light to up sign outside?
