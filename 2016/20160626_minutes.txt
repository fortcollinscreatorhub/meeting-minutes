On The Move to Yendrabuilt facility:
We have not received the keys to the unit and have made arrangements to continue to rent the basement space probably through July while we wait for the total removal of materials from the new space. It has been decided that we should get some sort of wall built first before we start moving equipment in. Lou was concerned that we needed proper approval from the city and it could delay our move even further. If we could build a wall that would be considered “temporary”, we may be able to get something completed without a building permit. Steve will be looking into possible options.

On the booth at New West Fest:
Erik is collecting ideas on what to have at our booth at New West Fest. We will have electric hookups if we want to display a working 3D printer or some other device. Jim will look into getting the “Reactable” from the museum and is willing to lend one of his LED wheel lights. Kit reminded us that we could also show some of the projects that the kids made at the maker camp.


On Tax prep due end of the month:
Erik asked for help on getting information about service accomplishments for the narrative documentation required by the IRS. A motion was made to authorize up to 3 hours of accountant time if needed to finalize the books for the year. Lou and Steve offered to help Erik with data collection and wording of the documents.

Lockers:
We think we will be able to rent some locker space for members who might need to safely store their projects. A bank of lockers was purchased by Jim from the Sports Authority store.

On changing the size of the current board:
It would be beneficial if we had a larger board, especially on that had some artists. To do this we have to amend the by-laws so that we could have a board membership range from 3 to 15 for instance instead of the now fixed number of 5. Jim will see what needs to be done in order to change this.

Next Meeting:
