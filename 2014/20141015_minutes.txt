Minutes of the Fort Collins Creator Hub meeting
2014/10/15 7pm, Jukebox Quilts

Provisional Board Members present:
Curt Oliver
Steve Undy
Stephen Warren

Excused:
Ben Gondrez

Various other members were present.

= Maker Faire

There were lots of great booths, and much to see.

Lots of people from Fort Collins visited. Various members made contacts with
interesting local companies (Lulzbot for cheap old 3D printers, a local
3D printer/CNC company looking for beta testers, OtterCares foundation for
funding, etc.)

Booth staffing: More than 2 people at a time would be a good idea, so people
can go see the show, handle the variable booth traffic, etc.

= Spaces

No progress; people have been busy.

However, we're mostly holding off until our paperwork is all in place.

It sounds like FCPAN (tenants of the Carnegie building) are actively expecting
us to move in!

AI: Brad: Talk to Ben ...
AI: Jim: ... and the FCPAN contact to find out what's up the Carnegie
building.

= Communication

Some meetup.com members weren't even aware we had a booth at Maker Faire! We
need to be very pro-active to publicise the vote on bylaws and board.

Suggest: We do the following to the next meeting:
- Send to the mailing list
- Use meetup's admin ability to email everyone
- Post to meetup discussion forum
- Create a specific meetup event for this, to make it obvious it's separate
  from the regular bi-weekly meeting.

AI: SteveU: Check if any library spaces are available for the meeting; we
expect/hope a large number of people. Also check with Ben re: the museum.
Or, find an alternate space. Ensure the meeting is publicized as above.

= Bylaws

We discussed various comments in the bylaws document, and resolved those
comments. Nothing too contentious. A brief summary of the resolve comments:

Comment: General Meeting needs 8 weeks notice, which we won't have the
first time around.

Resolution: The first time around, all Board Member positions will be vacant
so we'll use the vacant Board Member clauses. The first General Meeting will
be next year.

Comment: Is 18 years of age too old as the minimum for a Member? What about
responsible older children?

Resolution: (voting) Members should be 18 years of age. The membership
agreement (e.g. for a family membership) can contain a list of Members and
other classes (e.g. Minors) of people associated with the Member(s). Members
get the right to vote according to these bylaws. Minors are allowed into the
space according to whatever rules we impose in the membership agreement, but
cannot vote, and hence aren't explicitly mentioned in the bylaws.

Comment: The President acting alone can trigger a meeting for Emergency
Corporate Action. Is this too much power?

Resolution: This doesn't give the President too much power, since to pass a
resolution in the meeting, 50% of Members must vote to pass anything, and that
50% could call a meeting anyway.

Comment: Do we maintain quorum of Board Members if any Board Member(s) have a
conflict of interest, and abstain from voting?

Resolution: We reworded this section slightly. People who have abstained are
still present, and hence quorum is maintained, if it already existed.

Comment: Should we allow nominations for Board Members at the meeting to elect
them?

Resolution: Allowing people to stand for positions at the last minute is
desired. We should make it easy for people to serve the organization.

Comment: To become a Member, another Member must nominate/support them. Since
we have no members, this is not possible.

Resolution: Prior to the bylaws being adopted, they do not apply. For
example, prior to the adoption of the bylaws, we could define a Member as
anyone willing to sign a membership agreement. As soon as the bylaws are
adopted, we will need everyone to have signed a membership agreement, since
that's part of the bylaws. We should ensure that people do this at the
meeting.

AI: StephenW: Create initial (very bare) membership agreement to bootstrap the
definition of Member once bylaws are voted in. Print this and bring it to the
meeting.
