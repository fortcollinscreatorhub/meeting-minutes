= Maker Faire

Mark Schreiber demoonstrated the Maker Faire activity. It looks awesome!

Erik brought along a home-made guitar to demo at the Faire.

Please sign up for equipment donations for the Faire. We need copper tape,
LEDs, coin cell batteries, conductive tape, etc. for decorating the sculpture
pieces with simple circuits. Sign up at:

Also feel free to help out staffing the booth at Maker Faire. Eeven though the
booth staffing sign-up is technically full, more people can only help get the
word out.

= Bylaws

A draft has been completed. It's publically readable on Google Docs. Please
read and comment on them over the next 2 weeks, e.g. by adding a comment
directly in the Google Document itself, or emailing:

Stephen Warren <swarren@wwwdotorg.org>
Curt Oliver <curt@laika.cc>
Erik Andersen <andersenerikw@gmail.com>

We'll address comments when they're received and/or discuss any final issues
at the next meeting. We'll also set a time to vote on them at that meeting.

= Survey

A draft of the survey is complete. It needs a few minor tweaks, but will be
posted soon; hopefully by the end of this week.

The survey is intended to get an idea of what equipment, activities, classes,
etc. people are most interested in. This will drive our business plan.

= Donations

Donations are enabled on the meetup.com site. If you feel inclined, feel free
to donate. However, this is mainly for micro- or opportunistic donations at
present.

Our main fund-raising drive will likely wait until our business plan is in
place; this will help people understand what they're donating to, and how
their donation will be used.

Examples of some upcoming costs: ~$800 for 501(c)3 application, capital to
back rent.

= Location

Some potential locations are in Google Docs. Feel free to add any leads you
have. We haven't started significant efforts to make contact with realtors
yet, but should probably do so soon.

It'd be very useful to find building owners or foundations that could help
us out with below-market rent, finding locations that are a good fit, general
support, etc. Please pursue all your personal contacts to help us find these
people.
