Minutes of the Fort Collins Creator Hub meeting
2014/12/10 7pm, Cohere old town

= Location

Carnegie building likely won't pan out; building owners looking at going a
different direction than a member-funded open-access maker space.

Jukebox Quilts basement sounds like the best bet for now. We likely need to
get 501c3 filed before actually signing the contract. Board members agreed we
should move forward with this as soon as practical.

= Fundraising

Definition of Founding Member: Give $300 by end of March 2015 (or 3 months
after we announce the fundraising program?).

Crowdsourcing site fees quite high. Let's start with ad-hoc donations (checks,
etc.) to see if we can raise the initial ~$3000 we need file for 501c3 and
move in to Jukebox Quilts. Let's make sure we have 501c3 ready to file before
launching this. Board in agreement on this approach.

We should write up a description of the space, why we need funds, what they'll
be used for, and what people get out of contributing. We'll present this to
people to solicit funds to file 501c3, pay initial rent/move-in costs, etc.
Post this to meetup.com, our social media, have people forward it to
co-workers, etc.

AI: Brad to come up with a first version. Will run it by StephenW, Sierra,
then once it looks reasonable, StephenW will post it to meetup, Facebook, G+,
our website.

Payment methods people will be given:
* Given check to Erik in person.
* Mail check to PO Box.
* Bill pay check to PO Box.
* Cash.
* Paypal.

AI: StephenW: Ensure donations@fortcollinscreatorhub.org and forward to Erik
gmail.com.

AI: Erik: Set up Paypal account using that address.

= Making us look attractive

We should add as many (non-board meeting) events on meetup.com as possible.

Where can we hold these though; library limits to one per event per 5 weeks.

AI: Galen: Check into CSU options.

AI: Curt: Post call for events (what classes people want) on the meetup.

StephenW offered a variety of talks. SteveU offered more Arduino. Curt offered
a brewing talk. A class on bike maintenance at the bike co-op would be
interesting.

= 501c3

Form is mostly filled out, almost ready. Would appreciate final review.

AI: Erik: Ensure 501c3 PDF is uploaded in Drive, and is viewable once
downloaded.

AI: Board: Review the document, be ready to approve next meeting.

= Bank Account

Account is with First Bank.

Anyone can deposit by walking into a branch, using our account name. Can
cross-check using Curt's/Ben's name.

AI: Curt to obtain check(s) from the bank, so we can write them.

AI: Curt/Erik to transfer the signatures etc. within the next week or so.

= PO Box

Board approves setting up a PO Box at USPS Boardwalk.
(StephenW will fund this)

AI: StephenW to deposit funds 12/11.

AI: StephenW/Curt to set up the PO Box ASAP.

= Incorporation

Board approves re-filing with new officers and PO Box as the address.
(Curt will fund this)

AI: Curt: Re-file ASAP once we have PO Box set up.

We should try and resolve business via email without waiting for the meeting.
