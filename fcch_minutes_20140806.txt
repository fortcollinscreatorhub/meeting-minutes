Fort Collins Creator Hub meeting minutes
2014/08/06 7pm @ Wild Boar

= Business

- We have filed with the state, and have our EIN.

- We have started working on bylaws.

- We need to officially elect a board/officers and adopt our bylaws.

  People standing for positions:
  President: Ben
  Secretary: StephenW
  Treasurer: Curt
  VP: StephenU volunteered, those attending approved.
    Description:
    - Stands in for P if not attending
    - Typically committees report to VP

  Should have at least 1 more. "Member at large"? (someone not an officer,
  but a member of the board). Diverse. Keep an odd number for tie-breaks.

  Will amend articles/bylaws with those positions.

  AI: Everyone/board at next meeting: Board to officially ratify the board
  membership and bylaw text.

= Finance

- Bank account already set up, contains $20.
- Can start accepting donations/...
- Proposed: We should get a Paypal, Square, ... account
  - Curt: Hard to track Square at least; might not be good
  - Brad: Paypal has bad business policies (freezing accounts)
  - Curt looking into the options

Question raised: Are people willing to donate some money to cover various misc
fees, like room rentals, Maker Faire registration, etc.? Generally affirmative.

Should we have founding members, who donate a larger amount at the start? Seems
like a good idea. Perhaps $300; has worked at other spaces. Why? Need to fund
first few months of rent, tool purchases, insurance, business registration,
domain fees, etc. without the worry of month-to-month issues initially. How
long to offer this? Depends on many factors like how many founders we want, how
much rent is, etc.

AI: Curt: Work on budget. (Will drive how we define founder fees.)

= Educational outreach

== Arduino class

- Steve giving Arduino class 8/23 at the Harmony library.
- Mark offered 10 laptops for use.
- StephenW offered to borrow 10 SIKs from LCS, Steve borrowing the rest from
  work.

  AI: anyone/everyone: Volunteer to help setting up, tearing down, assist class
  more than welcome. Comment on the meetup event to volunteer.

== Min Make Faire

- October 4-5 in Loveland.
- We're getting a free 10x20 space w/ 2 8' tables & chairs.
- Paid $25 for extra power outlets.
- Can rent extra tables, for a fee.
- 8 free entry passes.
- Setup is on Friday.
- Intend to run a child-oriented activity:
  - Brushbots?
  - Kids drawn in by projectiles...

AI: Mark Schreiber was volunteered to organize the activities.
AI: Dan to assist.

AI: Nearer the time: Need a volunteer list for booth staffing, setup and
teardown.

AI: StephenU: to check on can we bring our own extra tables, or have to rent
from the organizers.

AI: Erik: proposed he give a bike maintenance class. Perhaps early-mid Sep, on
a Sunday. Need to setup this up (find space, add to meetup).

AI: StephenW: volunteered to re-do all the classes he's done @ LCS. Need to
setup this up (find space, add to meetup).

= Space/location

- Brad mentioned available space for classes in old-town.
- http://www.artlabfortcollins.com/
- Check website for their calendar. Email them at the address on their
  site to ask for space.

- Carnegie building: No update available.

= Web/social media

- Facebook is set up.

- Arduino class advertized in FC newspaper.

- Still working on logos; progressing.
- Hopefully available for vote next meeting.
- There was a request to post the images on meetup to allow voting quickly
  rather than waiting until next meeting. 

AI: Diana: post the potential logos to meetup and set up voting when they
are ready.

(Not quite serious) Proposed: everyone make their own shirt as membership
requirement:-)

= Two questions from Sierra

- Answers will help inform the branding.

- Encourage people to send responses directly (e.g. meetup forum post) so I'm
  not interpreting them.

1) What 1 word would you use to describe the space?
Some answers at the meeting:
- Nebulous. Virtual.
- Community. Sharing. Workshop. Knowledge. Experience.
- Look at profile responses on meetup; similar Q was asked there.

2) List the 3 most important things about the space.
Some answers at the meeting:
- Community. Not just a place to go by yourself. Shared space/resources.
- Teaching. Learning. Outreach. Stop people being afraid of science/math.
  Mentorships and/or someone to bounce ideas off.
- More than just a virtual thing, physical space since people don't have it
  themselves. Tools/equipment.
- Open & inviting. Easy to have fun. Whether someone makes things or not isn't
  an issue.
- Cross-pollination. See what others are doing & get inspiration. Sharing
  ideas.
- Diversity. People & areas of interest. Fabric, welding, plasma cutter, yarn
  bombing, all together/intersecting. Not just a bunch of geek buys. Go
  outside the box. Kids able to get involved. Support things you're not
  personally interested in to grow diversity.
- Want to push the technology forward. 3D printing w/metal not just plastic.
  Scaling tools to the next level. Self-replicating tools.
- Proximity (nearer than Loveland/Longmont).

= Tinkermill visit

We're visiting Tinkermill's fairgrounds location 8/10 at 2pm
http://www.tinkermill.org/
1840 Delaware Place, Longmont, CO 80501

The idea is to get inspired by seeing a successful existing space in action.

We will meet at College/Harmony Max transport station 1pm Sun 8/10 to carpool.

AI: StephenW post park/ride info on meetup.

= Misc

Need list of AIs in minutes.
(hopefully inline as they are here is fine; they are all prefixed with "AI:")
