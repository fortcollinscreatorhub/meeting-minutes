Maker space search:
We brought up the idea (again) about the Carnegie Building. While it would not be worth our effort to locate into another basement maker space, the concept was rekindled when the idea of possibly using the space on the upper level of the building for our clean room space. It is currently being used as a free-use room called the “Idea Lab”. Lou Sharpe had a phone conversation with Jill Stillwell, the Cultural Services Director for the City of Fort Collins. It seemed apparent from Jill that the space in the Carnegie was intended for use as an “Artist Space” of some sort but that some of the activities at the Hub would fit that description. The Hub's association with the Poudre Library next door and the Public Access Studio in the basement of the building would help with the argument that we should locate to that area; Could we be an artist's maker space with electronics and computer geeks on the side? 

On Growing the Organization:
Steve mentioned that April submitted a grant application for $1k to help pay for some of the electronics kits. He also reminded the board that we should work on creating a dedicated core of people to “get the word out” that we exist. Do we need new tools to draw in new members?  A better laser cutter was suggested or perhaps we should upgrade our existing cutter?

Other activities:
Bill Tucker asked if we would be able to host either a CodeKata or Coding Dojo at the Hub. The board agreed that we could do something like this once a month like we have done for the Linux Users Group.

Brad mentioned the pains of adding a Windows partition to the laptops and will try some new ideas to work out some of the issues he is having. Brad also asked to work on meeting protocols which probably wouldn't be a bad idea.

Steve suggested we hold a “Show And Tell” at the Hub on the First Friday Art Walk since people stroll by our location on the way to the photography exhibit next door.

Jim told the group that he is regularly adding Hub activities to the event calendar of the Coloradoan Newspaper.
