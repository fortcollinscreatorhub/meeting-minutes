Minutes of the Fort Collins Creator Hub meeting
2014/08/20 7pm, Daz Bog coffee shop

Visitor Mike Croswell from the Fort Collins Game Developers group visited to
see what we were about. They meet on 2nd Mondays at Avo's 6:30-8pm.

= Committee Check-in 

== Finance

Bank account still has $20 in it.

Ben wondering about a "community funded" campaign (similar to Kickstarter).
Possible benefits over Kickstarter: Lower fee (2%), no "don't meet your goal"
issue (although that may not apply to non-profits on Kickstarter anyway).

Discussion re: length of time to get 501c3: a year sounds likely. Can we use
another as an umbrella? Ben/Curt researching options for that.

== Web / Social media 

Facebook is set up. Google+ coming next.

Need content: Please send info on project/photos/videos to Diana Sproul
<Diana@SproulCreative.com>.

A press release was sent out for the Intro to Arduino class. A poster is
posted in all libraries.

AI: Diana: do the same for Intro to Electronics class.

AI: Stephen: send Diana a bio+email+phone for poster for Intro to Electronics
class.

== Logo / Branding 

Some options are ready. Samples on paper were shown.

AI: Diana/Sierra: Post the proposed logos to meetup site for everyone to see,
along with a poll to enable all members to vote. Hopefully this weekend, so
voting can finish before next meeting.

== Location

Technically no committee set up yet. We should form one!

Carnegie building (old museum location) update: None yet (Jill Stilwell @ city
on vacation?). Might be available as a classroom space unrelated to whether we
rent it.

Got a tip-off about a ~$5k s.f. warehouse near old airport. ~$6+/s.f./year,
so rather expensive once it's multiplied up (~2700/month). Need to add NNN and
renovation/start-up costs too (we'd need to pay for a new electric drop for
example).

Ki volunteered a potential classroom space (somewhere near old skate park)
that's being developed for an arts organization. Not developed yet, but
hopefully soon. If we were to schedule a class there, that would provide
incentive to get the space ready.

AI: Ben visting the space Ki offered to see what it's like.

Planning what equipment we want:
- Initially lots of it will be donations.
- Don't want to over-specialize to avoid turning some people off.
- Some activities not compatible with others in the same space; need multiple
  rooms, ventilation, dust collection, noise abatement, etc.
- Start with broad set of basic tools to appeal to many, then get more advanced
  stuff later?
- Should generate a priority list of equipment and activities.

AI: Mike to set up a list on meetup to allow to suggest what they want. Later,
make it into a poll to enable prioritization.

== Education / Outreach

Two classes already scheduled:

=== Intro to Arduino class

Sat 8/23 at Harmony library. Room booked from 11am for setup. 12pm class start.

Need help with:
- Setup, and tear down.
- Assistants during class.
- Taking photos for publicity.
  ***Make sure you get permission and mention posting to social media site***

Software install available at http://arduino.cc/ if you want to put it on your
own machine.

=== Intro to Electronics class.

Sun 9/7 at Old Town library. Room booked from 2pm for setup. 2:15pm class
start.

(Might move to the space Ki offered, if it's suitable).

Please publicize to friends in person and on social media, etc.

= Bylaws / Board of Directors 

== Discuss and develop Member at Large position

One suggestion was to have a person responsible for each activity to champion
resources for that activity. Some other spaces do have this.

== Hopefully finalize draft and accept

Ben/Erik working on incorporating the comments on the bylaws. Voting on them
postponed until that work is complete.

== Fill vacant board positions and ratify 

Postponed per the above.

= Maker Faire

We're attending. All booked. Mark Schreiber working on planning activities.

We should take photos for publicity.
***Make sure you get permission and mention posting to social media site***
(although people may already have signed a release to enter the faire)

= Any other business

None.

= Next meeting

In 2 weeks time, location TBA.
