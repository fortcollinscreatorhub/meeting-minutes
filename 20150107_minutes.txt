Math Stein attended to remind us to follow up with the library re: helping out
with classes they want to run. Good for exposure of the group. Can also
override limits on the number of events/classes/meetings we can hold there.

    (StephenW found the email and forwarded it since that fulfilled both AIs)

works there. No response yet, but will follow up.

Board liked StephenW's proposed text for Founding Fees solicitation
message. $300 Founders Fee approved. We will send out the message as soon

AI: StephenW: Update the text to:
- Rephrase not to ask/beg for money, but to phrase it as an opportunity to
  donate.

Founders.
